# Welcome to the Saloon

This is a gated, anonymous message board for CityDAO Citizens that hold a token from ```0x7EeF591A6CC0403b9652E98E88476fe1bF31dDeb```. 

It's goal is to be a fun, positive place to send messages, gossip, share things on your mind you might not want to say 'publicly', and otherwise try something simple that can be added to over time.

Addresses are not displayed in relation to messages and are never saved to any database.

Messages can, and might be, deleted at anytime for whatever reason.
