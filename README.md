# Welcome to the Saloon

This is an NFT gated, anonymous message board for CityDAO Citizens that hold a token from ```0x7EeF591A6CC0403b9652E98E88476fe1bF31dDeb```. 

Should you choose to enter you will connect to the site and then sign a message (zero gas) to prove Citizen status, then proceed to the bar.

We have our digital townhalls that are more formal and tied to our identities and reputation. This is the saloon, the informal part of town.

It's goal is to be a fun, positive place to send messages, gossip, share things on your mind you might not want to say 'publicly', and otherwise try something simple that can be added to over time. Zero expectations and zero polish.

Addresses are not displayed in relation to messages and are never saved to a database.

Messages can, and might be, deleted at anytime for whatever reason.

## Contributing

If you feel like adding to the site; fork, pull, branch, twist it, bop it, commit, push you know the drill.

Have an idea and don't know how to build it? Share it in the saloon and let's chat over a drink.
